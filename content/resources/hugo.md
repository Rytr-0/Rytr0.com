### Recources to learn about hugo:

- Videos:
  - [Hugo in 100 Seconds](https://youtu.be/0RKpf3rK57I)
    > Good introduction
  - [Hugo Actually Explained](https://youtu.be/ZFL09qhKi5I)
    > Very well 40 minutes guide. Even if you don't finish it, it's very good.

- Articles:
  - [Content Managment](https://gohugo.io/content-management/)
    > Very good guide to *where is what I am looking for* type of question.
  - [Deply with Rsync](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/deployment-with-rsync/)
    > Very good short guide to writing a simple `deploy.sh` script.
    
 - Themes:
  - [Hugo themes page](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
  >
  - My favorite themes:
    - [Glim Midnight](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/glim-midnight/)
    - [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/)
    - [Nightfall](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-nightfall/)
    - [Hello-friend-ng](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/)
    > And of course, [Risotto](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/risotto/)
    
    p.s. I liked [Ficurinia](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-ficurinia/) But it was giving me errors in the deployment for some reason.
