Hello World

I'm Rytr0, check the [about me](/about)

I also have cheat sheets because *we all forget commands* and end up reading a whole article looking for them.

The cheat sheets are *not articles*.

Find them [here](/cheatSheets) 

I assume that you know how to do basic linux things both in my cheat sheets and resources.

For resources to understand an app or something

Find them [here](/resources)
